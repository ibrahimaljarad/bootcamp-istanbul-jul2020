It was an incredibly hot[a] day, and a lion was feeling very hungry[a]. He came out of his den[n] and searched[v] here and there. He could find only a small[a] hare. He caught the hare with some hesitation. “This hare can’t fill my stomach[n]” thought the lion.

As the lion was about to kill the hare, a deer ran that way. The lion became[v] greedy. He thought: “Instead of eating this small hare, let me eat[v] the big deer.” He let the hare go and went[v] behind the deer[n]. But the deer had vanished into the forest. The lion now felt sorry for letting the hare off.

Moral of the story:
A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
