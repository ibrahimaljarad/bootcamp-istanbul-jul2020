Camping is great[a]. You can leave[v] the busy crowd[n] behind and go to the nature[n]. There is a chance that you may come across different animals[n]. It is always fun[a] to come together and chat[v] with your friends by the moon[n]. You can sleep[v] hearing the cheerful[a] sounds of the nature[n] and sleep watching the sky[n]. Do not forget to take your allergy medicines with you since there may be a lot of insects[n] by the lake[n] .
