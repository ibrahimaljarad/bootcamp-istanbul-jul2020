Alex[n] is an engineer[n] and she is a CIA agent[n] part-time. One day on the August fifth, she woke up feeling a bit strange[a]. She went to the bathroom[n] to take a shower[n]. When she got out of the shower, she heard that her phone[n] was ringing[v]. Her friend[n] from work was calling to tell her that she was needed[a] for the time-travel project[n] and she needed to bring the time-travel watch[n].

She got ready and got into her car[n]. On the way to work, she ate a sandwich[n]. While she was driving, she noticed a black car[n] was following her. She immediately[a] changed the direction to lose the car behind her. The car was out of sight, so, she thought that she lost the follower, but the car[n] appeared out of nowhere and crashed[v] her from the side. She hit her head[n] and lost consciousness[n]. Meanwhile, in the lab that she was working, the other engineers turned on the time-travel device for a test run. 

When she opened her eyes[n], she was in her bed[n], feeling a bit strange[a]. She looked at her phone[n], the date was August fifth.
